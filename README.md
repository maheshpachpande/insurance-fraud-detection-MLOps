# insurance-fraud-detection-MLOps
Insurance Fraud Detection MLOps Detects insurance fraud using ML with a robust CI/CD pipeline. Automates workflows with Airflow, tracks data/experiments/models with DVC &amp; MLflow, packages with Docker, deploys via Kubernetes, and monitors performance with Prometheus/Grafana. Ensures scalability and reliability.

Hereâ€™s a **clear, concise, and structured explanation** of the business problem, how machine learning helps, and its significance, based on your dataset:

---

## 1. Business Problem

Insurance companies face significant losses due to **fraudulent claims**.
From your data, the target variable `fraud_reported` indicates whether a claim is fraudulent (**Y**) or legitimate (**N**).

**Business challenge:**

* Fraud is often **hidden among legitimate claims**, making manual detection time-consuming and error-prone.
* False positives waste resources investigating genuine claims.
* False negatives allow fraudsters to succeed, costing money.

**Goal:**
Build a **data-driven, unbiased fraud detection system** to:

* Accurately identify fraudulent claims.
* Reduce manual investigation effort.
* Minimize financial loss.

## 2. How Machine Learning Helps

**Step-by-step approach:**

1. **Data Collection & Understanding**

   * Use historical claim records (`policy`, `incident`, `vehicle`, `customer` details) with known outcomes (`fraud_reported`).

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing data (e.g., `authorities_contacted`, `police_report_available`).
   * Encode categorical variables (e.g., `insured_sex`, `incident_type`).
   * Normalize/scale numerical features for fair comparison.

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Create derived features (e.g., claim ratio = total\_claim\_amount / policy\_annual\_premium).
   * Detect suspicious patterns (e.g., repeated claims by same zip code).

4. **Model Training**

   * Train ML algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to **predict fraud** based on patterns in data.

5. **Bias Mitigation**

   * Ensure model is not biased toward certain demographics (e.g., gender, location) by checking **fairness metrics**.
   * Balance fraud vs. non-fraud data to avoid class imbalance bias (e.g., SMOTEENN resampling).

6. **Evaluation & Validation**

   * Use metrics: **Precision, Recall, F1-score**.
   * Precision ensures fewer false accusations.
   * Recall ensures fraud is not missed.

7. **Deployment**

   * Integrate model into the claims pipeline for **real-time fraud scoring**.

8. **Monitoring & Feedback Loop**

   * Continuously track model performance.
   * Retrain with new claim data to adapt to evolving fraud tactics.

## 3. Significance of an ML-Based Non-Biased Solution

| **Benefit**                         | **Impact**                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Higher fraud detection accuracy** | Saves millions in fraudulent payouts.                        |
| **Faster claim processing**         | Reduces investigation backlog.                               |
| **Unbiased decision-making**        | Protects company from legal risks related to discrimination. |
| **Cost efficiency**                 | Minimizes unnecessary investigations.                        |
| **Adaptability**                    | Learns from new fraud patterns automatically.                |
