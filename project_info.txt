Conda environments keep project libraries separate and make it easy to recreate the same setup anywhere.

=================================================================================================================

setup.py is a Python script that defines how to package and install a project. 
It includes the project’s name, dependencies, and setup instructions so others can easily install and use it.

Run the command: pip install .
for development mode (so changes reflect without reinstalling): pip install -e .

=================================================================================================================

S (Single Responsibility) → Each class/module should do one thing.

O (Open/Closed) → Code should be open for extension, closed for modification.

L (Liskov Substitution) → Derived classes should be replaceable with base ones.

I (Interface Segregation) → Prefer small, specific interfaces over big ones.

D (Dependency Inversion) → Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
