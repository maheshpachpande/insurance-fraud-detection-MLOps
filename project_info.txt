Conda environments are essential in ML projects to **isolate project-specific dependencies**, 
preventing conflicts between different projects that may require different library versions. 
This ensures **reproducibility** by allowing a project's exact working environment 
to be shared and recreated on any machine, 
making it a critical tool for collaboration and production deployment.


The `setup.py` file is a script that tells Python how to package and install your project. 
It lists all the project's details, such as its name and required libraries. 
When someone installs your code, this file ensures everything is set up correctly, 
making it easy for others to use your work.
